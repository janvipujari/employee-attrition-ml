# employee-attrition-ml

PROJECT OVERVIEW-
-In this project, employee attrition was analyzed using machine learning techniques.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to understand patterns and factors that influence whether an employee leaves the company or not.
-A machine learning model was trained to predict employee attrition, which can help the HR department take preventive actions and improve employee retention.

DATA SET SOURCE
-IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition Dataset
-The dataset contains information about employees such as age, department, job role, salary, years at company, job satisfaction, and attrition status.

MODEL USED
-Random Forest Classifier
-This model was used because it provides good accuracy and works well for classification problems.

EVALUATION METRICS
The model performance was evaluated using:
-Accuracy
-Precision
-Recall
-F1-score
-Confusion Matrix

STEPS TO RUN THE NOTEBOOK-
-open your project folder in VS code having the dataset saved in .csv file.
-Install required libraries using the requirements.txt file.
- make a file name it ML_project.ipynb
- Open the file ML_project.ipynb.
- Run the notebook cells one by one or click Run All.
- The results and model evaluation will be displayed after execution.
